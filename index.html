    <h1>The Psychic Game</h1>

    <p>Guess what letter I'm thinking of</p>

    <P>Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly</P>
    <p>Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)</p>
    <p>Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)</p>
    <p>Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. 
        Display these until the user either wins or loses.)</p>

    // ---- game resets, loss is tallied, and computer chooses new key when guesses run out to 0
